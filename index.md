### Project Overview

Remote sensing plays a critical role in the study and management of coastal ecosystems (Figure 1). As a key example, satellite imagery enables accurate land cover mapping at medium resolution (Figure 2) and these land cover maps can be compared from year to year to understand large scale change and ecosystem dynamics. Unoccupied aerial systems (UAS, aka drones) complement satellites, providing on-demand remote sensing capabilities at low cost and with modular sensors that can assess a wide variety of variables.

While powerful tools, satellites and UAS generate massive amounts of data. The expertise and time required to analyze this imagery is an obstacle in using it to understand long term land cover dynamics and quickly analyze impacts of storms â€“ an obstacle machine learning is well poised to mitigate.

The purpose of this project is to develop a methodology for rapid and high-resolution monitoring of the coastal Southeast US.
We will do so by leveraging deep learning to automate land cover mapping in satellite imagery. The change detected by comparing yearly land cover maps will guide UAS surveys for areas that experienced substantial change.

#### Team Leadership
This team is lead by [Patrick Gray](https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/students/gray), [Justin Ridge](https://sites.duke.edu/justinridge/), and [David Johnston](https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/johnston), of the [Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Lab](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/uas/) at the Duke University Marine Lab. 


### About the Project
This project was funded by [Duke Bass Connections](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/) a program that "bridges the classroom and the real world, giving students a chance to roll up their sleeves and tackle complex societal problems." Teams of graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and undergraduate students collaborate on novel research projects across disciplines. The project was run primarily by the [Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/uas/) at the [Duke Marine Lab](https://nicholas.duke.edu/marinelab).

Computational expenses on Microsoft Azure were supported by the [Microsoft AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) program. [North Carolina Space Grant](https://ncspacegrant.ncsu.edu/) and the NASA Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) supported graduate student time.
